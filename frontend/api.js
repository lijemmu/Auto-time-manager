// first step: grab calendar data from API (work with Fernanda to see how this is done)


// function: format data from user's calendar into JSON to send to Flask app


// function (triggered by button): send the data to Flask app


// get the response from the Flask app, which should hopefully be JSON formatted in the same way


// post the data to the calendar API to update the user's calendar


// maybe alert the user on the frontend that the task was successful (or if there was an error)
